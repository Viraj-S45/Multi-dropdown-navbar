## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to create and style the custom navbar:

- HTML: Used to structure the content and layout of the navbar.
- CSS: Used for styling and positioning of the navbar and its components.
- JavaScript: Used to implement interactivity, including dropdown menus.

The project also uses the Boxicons library for icons and font customization.
## Setup

To use the custom navbar on your website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the provided files.

2. Include the necessary files in your project:

- Copy the contents of the style.css and javascript.js files into your corresponding CSS and JavaScript files.

- Make sure to include the Boxicons library by adding the following line to the <head> section of your HTML file:

```
<link href="https://unpkg.com/boxicons@2.1.4/css/boxicons.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

3. Include the provided fonts by placing them in a fonts directory within your project.

4. Integrate the HTML structure for the navbar into your existing HTML file.

5. Customize the content, links, and styles according to your website's design and requirements.

## Usage

The custom navbar provides an intuitive navigation experience for users visiting your website. It categorizes different hosting options, VPS services, email solutions, and domain-related features. Users can click on the dropdown arrows to reveal more information and options within each category.

To make use of the dropdown functionality, the provided JavaScript code should be included in your project. This code handles the opening and closing of dropdown menus when a link is clicked and ensures that clicking anywhere outside the dropdown closes it.

The CSS styles provided in the style.css file can be modified to match your website's branding and design. Adjust colors, fonts, spacing, and other styles as needed.
